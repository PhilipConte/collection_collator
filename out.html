<p>Egypt has one of the longest histories of any country, tracing its heritage back to the 6th–4th millennia BCE. Considered a <a href="cradle of civilisation">cradle of civilisation</a>, <a href="Ancient Egypt">Ancient Egypt</a> saw some of the earliest developments of writing, agriculture, urbanisation, organised religion and central government.&lt;ref&gt;<a href="Template:Cite book">Template:Cite book</a>&lt;/ref&gt; Iconic monuments such as the <a href="Giza Necropolis">Giza Necropolis</a> and its <a href="Great Sphinx of Giza">Great Sphinx</a>, as well the ruins of <a href="Memphis, Egypt">Memphis</a>, <a href="Thebes, Egypt">Thebes</a>, <a href="Karnak">Karnak</a>, and the <a href="Valley of the Kings">Valley of the Kings</a>, reflect this legacy and remain a significant focus of scientific and popular interest. Egypt's long and rich cultural heritage is an integral part of its national identity, which has endured, and often assimilated, various foreign influences, including <a href="Greeks">Greek</a>, <a href="Persians">Persian</a>, <a href="Romans">Roman</a>, <a href="Arab">Arab</a>, <a href="Ottomans">Ottoman Turkish</a>, and <a href="Nubian people">Nubian</a>.

<p>From the 16th to the beginning of the 20th century, Egypt was ruled by foreign imperial powers: <a href="The Ottoman Empire">The Ottoman Empire</a> and the <a href="British Empire">British Empire</a>. Modern Egypt dates back to 1922, when it gained nominal independence from the <a href="British Empire">British Empire</a> as a monarchy. However, <a href="British military">British military</a> occupation of Egypt continued, and many Egyptians believed that the monarchy was an instrument of British colonialism. Following the <a href="Egyptian revolution of 1952">1952 revolution</a>, Egypt expelled British soldiers and bureaucrats and ended British occupation, nationalized the British-held Suez Canal, exiled <a href="King Farouk">King Farouk</a> and his family, and declared itself a <a href="Republic of Egypt (1953–58)">republic</a>.

In 1978, Egypt signed the <a href="Camp David Accords">Camp David Accords</a>, officially withdrawing from the Gaza Strip and <a href="Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty">recognising Israel</a>.
